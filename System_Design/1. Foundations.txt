Let's begin with a web app.

The world is moving in 1.Async 2.Microservice directions.

Let's assume the web app is hosted on a single server.

The web app has the following components:
(There are many options for each component, each for differnt applications. 
I would like to use the tech stack that target async operations and microservices architecture.)
1. Frontend language(TypeScript (typed JavaScript))
2. Frontend framework (React--Meta, Angular--Google)
3. Backend language (Python, TypeScript (typed JavaScript))
4. Backend framework (FastAPI (Python), NestJS (Node.js))
5. Web server (Nginx--Standard baseline, Custom servers for big techs)
6. Database (PostgreSQL--Best for async)
7. Caching layer (Redis--Standard baseline)
